		<h2>Figure</h2>
		<p>Use a < figure > element to mark up a photo in a document: <br>
		< figure>
  < img src="img_pulpit.jpg" alt="The Pulpit Rock" width="304" height="228">
< /figure> <br><br>
The < figure > tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. <br>

While the content of the < figure > element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.
